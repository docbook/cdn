# DocBook releases and resources

This repository contains official releases of the
[DocBook XSLT 2.0 Stylesheets](https://github.com/docbook/xslt20-stylesheets) and ancillary
resource files (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) used by those stylesheets.

If you are interested in patching the DocBook XSLT 2.0 Stylesheets, please clone
the [source repository](https://github.com/docbook/xslt20-stylesheets) not this one.

I haven't really figured out how best to deal with the resources. They might move to a
separate source repository too, eventually.
