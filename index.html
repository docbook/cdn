<h1>Welcome to docbook.github.com</h1>
<p>This site hosts some JavaScript, CSS, and other ancillary files referenced by
the DocBook stylesheets. You're welcome to leave the references in place, or copy
these assets to your local server.</p>

<p>I haven't worked out a policy for dealing with versioning these files, so all
that's available right now is “latest”. YMMV.</p>
