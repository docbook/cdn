# DocBook XSLT 2.0 Stylesheets

These are the XSLT 2.0 stylesheets for DocBook. These stylesheets
represent a different line of development from the XSLT 1.0
stylesheets
[maintained at SourceForge.net](http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/).

That said, they are clearly derived from that work, so tip o' the hat
to everyone who's helped over there. And a special nod to Jirka Kosek
who did a lot of work on the XSLT 2.0 FO stylesheets.

Although I've been using the 2.0 stylesheets almost exclusively for
more than a year, they have only very recently had any sort of public
release. There are probably bugs.

Releases are published at [docbook.github.com](http://docbook.github.com/).

Resources (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) are maintained in
[a separate repository](https://github.com/docbook/xslt20-resources).

Share and enjoy
