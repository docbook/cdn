# DocBook XSLT 2.0 Stylesheets

These are the XSLT 2.0 stylesheets for DocBook. These stylesheets
represent a different line of development from the XSLT 1.0
stylesheets
[maintained at SourceForge.net](http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/).

That said, they are clearly derived from that work, so tip o' the hat
to everyone who's helped over there. And a special nod to Jirka Kosek
who did a lot of work on the XSLT 2.0 FO stylesheets.

Although I've been using the 2.0 stylesheets almost exclusively for a
couple of years, there may still be bugs. The test suite is running
again now, though, so that should be less and less the case.

Releases are published at [docbook.github.com](http://docbook.github.com/).

Resources (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) are maintained in
[a separate repository](https://github.com/docbook/xslt20-resources).

Some image options, such as scaling, require information about the intrinsic
size of the image. There are Java extension functions for this purpose.
They are maintained in
[another repository](https://github.com/docbook/xslt20-java). Put them
on your class path. They are also
[in Maven](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22docbook-xsl-java-saxon%22), if you prefer.
