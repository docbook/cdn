                  <div class="linegroup">
                     <div class="speaker">KING RICHARD II</div>
                     <div class="line">I have been studying how I may compare</div>
                     <div class="line">This prison where I live unto the world:</div>
                     <div class="line">And for because the world is populous</div>
                     <div class="line">And here is not a creature but myself,</div>
                     <div class="line">I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.</div>
                     <div class="line">My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,</div>
                     <div class="line">My soul the father; and these two beget</div>
                     <div class="line">A generation of still-breeding thoughts,</div>
                     <div class="line">And these same thoughts people this little world,</div>
                     <div class="line">In humours like the people of this world,</div>
                     <div class="line">For no thought is contented. The better sort,</div>
                     <div class="line">As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd</div>
                     <div class="line">With scruples and do set the word itself</div>
                     <div class="line">Against the word:</div>
                     <div class="line">As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,</div>
                     <div class="line">'It is as hard to come as for a camel</div>
                     <div class="line">To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'</div>
                     <div class="line">Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot</div>
                     <div class="line">Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails</div>
                     <div class="line">May tear a passage through the flinty ribs</div>
                     <div class="line">Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,</div>
                     <div class="line">And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.</div>
                     <div class="line">Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves</div>
                     <div class="line">That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,</div>
                     <div class="line">Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars</div>
                     <div class="line">Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,</div>
                     <div class="line">That many have and others must sit there;</div>
                     <div class="line">And in this thought they find a kind of ease,</div>
                     <div class="line">Bearing their own misfortunes on the back</div>
                     <div class="line">Of such as have before endured the like.</div>
                     <div class="line">Thus play I in one person many people,</div>
                     <div class="line">And none contented: sometimes am I king;</div>
                     <div class="line">Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,</div>
                     <div class="line">And so I am: then crushing penury</div>
                     <div class="line">Persuades me I was better when a king;</div>
                     <div class="line">Then am I king'd again: and by and by</div>
                     <div class="line">Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,</div>
                     <div class="line">And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,</div>
                     <div class="line">Nor I nor any man that but man is</div>
                     <div class="line">With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased</div>
                     <div class="line">With being nothing. Music do I hear?</div>
                     <p>Music</p>
                     <div class="line">Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,</div>
                     <div class="line">When time is broke and no proportion kept!</div>
                     <div class="line">So is it in the music of men's lives.</div>
                     <div class="line">And here have I the daintiness of ear</div>
                     <div class="line">To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;</div>
                     <div class="line">But for the concord of my state and time</div>
                     <div class="line">Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.</div>
                     <div class="line">I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;</div>
                     <div class="line">For now hath time made me his numbering clock:</div>
                     <div class="line">My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar</div>
                     <div class="line">Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,</div>
                     <div class="line">Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,</div>
                     <div class="line">Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.</div>
                     <div class="line">Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is</div>
                     <div class="line">Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,</div>
                     <div class="line">Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans</div>
                     <div class="line">Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time</div>
                     <div class="line">Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,</div>
                     <div class="line">While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.</div>
                     <div class="line">This music mads me; let it sound no more;</div>
                     <div class="line">For though it have holp madmen to their wits,</div>
                     <div class="line">In me it seems it will make wise men mad.</div>
                     <div class="line">Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!</div>
                     <div class="line">For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard</div>
                     <div class="line">Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.</div>
