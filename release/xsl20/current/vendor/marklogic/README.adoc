= MarkLogic README

The DocBook XSLT 2.0 stylesheets can be used in MarkLogic Server.
In order to do so, you must address two points:

1. The XSLT 2.0 stylesheets use a modular, pipeline-driven architecture.
Because MarkLogic Server doesn’t support XProc, an XQuery module must
be used to implement the pipeline.

2. The stylesheets import localization data. In many environments, the
universe of URIs available for accessing stylesheet modules and
document content are the same. Not so in MarkLogic Server which
segregates document content in a database from module content (in
either another database or on the filesystem).

You have several choices about where to store localization data:

a. You can store it in a separate database
b. You can store it on the filesystem
c. If your application uses a modules database, you can store
   them in the modules database
d. You can store them in your content database

The latter is simplest in some ways but does mean you have to
design the rest of your application to ignore the localization
files where appropriate.

== DocBook for everyone

The easiest way to install DocBook on MarkLogic Server is to place
the DocBook stylesheets in the system modules directory (often
`/opt/MarkLogic/Modules’):

....
$ mkdir /opt/MarkLogic/Modules/DocBook
$ cp -R docbook-xslt2-2.xx.xx/xslt/* /opt/MarkLogic/Modules/DocBook/
....

NOTE: The examples in this README assume Unix. FIXME:

That makes the DocBook stylesheets available to all application
servers on MarkLogic.

In order to invoke the stylesheets and load localization content,
we need to create a few roles, privileges, and amps. If you want
to store the localization content

If you’re running
MarkLogic Server 8.0-4 or later, you can do this automatically by
running the `setup.sh` script in this directory. Open the file in
your favorite editor and change the configuration variables at the
top of the script to suit your local environment, then run:

....
$ sh setup.sh
....

NOTE: It is possible to write this script in a cross-platform manner
with Python. FIXME:

If you have an earlier version of MarkLogic Server, or if you just
prefer to perform the admin tasks by hand, here is what must be done:

1. If you want to store the localization data in a separate database,
   create a forest and database for that purpose. You can name them
   anything you want, but we’ll assume they’re named `DocBook.locales`
   for the purposes of this document.
2. Create an execute privilege called `docbook-locales` with the
   action `http://docbook.org/vendor/marklogic/docbook-locales`. This
   privilege allows you to control which users can access the
   locales.
3. Create two roles named `docbook-locales` and `docbook-locales-internal`.
   You’ll assign the role `docbook-locales` to users whom you wish to
   allow to use DocBook. The internal role should never be assigned
   directly. We’ll use that in amps as you’ll see.
4. Give the `docbook-locales` role the `docbook-locales` execute privilege.
5. Give the `docbook-locales-internal` role the `xslt-invoke` and `xslt-eval`
   privileges.
6. If you plan to store the locale data in a separate database, give the
   `docbook-locales-internal` role the `xdmp-eval` and `xdmp-eval-in` privileges.
7. If you plan to store the locale data on the filesystem, give the
   `docbook-locales-internal` role the `xdmp-document-get` privilege.
8. Create an amp for the `load-from-database` function: use the
   namespace `http://docbook.org/vendor/marklogic/locales`, the local name
   `load-from-database`, the document uri
   `/DocBook/base/common/marklogic.xqy`, and use “`(filesystem)`” for the
   database. Give it the `docbook-locale-internal` privilege.
   Strictly speaking, this amp is only necessary if you plan
   to store the locale data in a separate database, but it won’t hurt to
   create it.
9. Create an amp for the `load-locale-filesystem` function: use the
   namespace `http://docbook.org/vendor/marklogic/locales`, the local name
   `load-locale-filesystem`, the document uri
   `/DocBook/base/common/marklogic.xqy`, and use “`(filesystem)`” for the
   database. Give it the `docbook-locale-internal` privilege.
   Strictly speaking, this amp is only necessary if you plan
   to store the locale data on the filesystem, but it won’t hurt to
   create it.
10. Create an amp for the `transform` function: use the
   namespace `http://docbook.org/vendor/marklogic/docbook` (note that it’s
   different from the preceding two!), the local name
   `transform`, the document uri
   `/DocBook/vendor/marklogic/docbook.xqy`, and use “`(filesystem)`” for the
   database. Give it the `docbook-locale-internal` privilege.
11. If you plan to store the locale data in a separate database, load
    all of the locale documents into that database. The `en.xml` locale should
    have the URI `/DocBook/locales/en.xml`, the `fr.xml` locale should
    have the URI `/DocBook/locales/fr.xml`, etc. Make sure that each
    file is readable by the `docbook-locale` role.

== DocBook for a specific application

NOTE: This section could use work. FIXME:

If you want to limit access to the DocBook stylesheets to specific
applications, the setup is as above with a few modifications.

IMPORTANT: You _must_ store the modules for your application in a modules
database. You cannot store them on the filesystem.

First, instead of storing the stylesheets in the global modules
directory, store them in your application’s modules directory:

....
$ mkdir /your/app/module/root/DocBook
$ cp -R docbook-xslt2-2.xx.xx/xslt/* /your/app/module/root/DocBook/
....

Next, apply each of the setup steps in the preceding section except
that when it comes time to create the amps, make sure that you specify
your application’s modules database instead of the filesystem.

=== DocBook without a modules database

Technically, I lied. If you want to limit access to DocBook to specific
applications and you want to store those application’s modules on the
filesystem, you can make that work. But the amps won’t work so you’ll
have to make sure that each user has the appropriate privileges
(`xslt-invoke`, `xslt-eval`, etc.) directly.

This is not recommended. YMMV. Your gun, your bullet, your foot.

== Using DocBook

Now that you have DocBook setup, you can invoke it like so:

....
import module namespace mldb="http://docbook.org/vendor/marklogic/docbook"
    at "/DocBook/vendor/marklogic/docbook.xqy";

declare default function namespace "http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions";

declare option xdmp:mapping "false";

let $doc := doc("my-docbook-doc.xml")
return
  mldb:to-html($doc)
....

You can test your installation as follows:

1. Create a user and give them the `docbook-locales` role.
2. Create an HTTP application server. Set its root to the path where
   you’ve unpacked the distribution. To the directory containing _this_
   README file. Set the port to anything you’d like, say 8123. If you
   want to store the locales in the content database, point the server
   at a content database where you’ve installed them. (If you want to
   store the locales in the modules database, you’ll have to move
   this directory into your modules database along with the locales.)
3. Try to open `http://localhost:8123/docbook-test.xqy`. If you get a
   page that says, in part, “everything is ok”, you win!

If not, well, feel free to ask.
