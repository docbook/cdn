DocBook xslTNG version 1.1.1

This directory contains an experimental Dockerfile. Using docker
allows you to isolate the environment necessary to run the DocBook
xslTNG stylesheets from your local environment.

1. Build the docker image. In this directory, run the docker build
   command:

   docker build -t docbook-xslt .

   The "-t" option provides a tag for the image; you can make this
   anything you want. There's a VERSION build argument if you want
   to build a particular release. For example,

   docker build --build-arg VERSION=0.9.14 -t docbook-xslt .

   will build a Docker image for the 0.9.14 release of the stylesheets
   irrespective of the version in the Dockerfile.

2. Run the image, for example:

   docker run docbook-xsltng samples/article.xml

   If you chose a different tag when you built the image, use that tag
   in place of 'docbook-xsltng' in the run command. Everything after the
   container tag becomes options to the 'docbook' Python script.

   Note that the context the script runs in is *inside* the container.
   It can't for example, see your local filesystem.

You can use the Docker facilities for mounting directories to change
what documents the script can access. For example:

   docker run -v /tmp:/output -v /path/to/samples:/input \
          docbook-xsltng /input/article.xml chunk=index.html \
          chunk-output-base-uri=/output/

Assuming that the 'samples' directory in the distribution is located
at /path/to/samples, this will chunk the article.xml sample document
that the script sees in /input (which is where you mounted samples)
and it will write the output to /output (which is where you mounted
/tmp).

When the script finishes, the chunked output will be in /tmp
