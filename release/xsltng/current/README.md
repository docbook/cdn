Hello. You’ve found this repository during it’s “soft opening.” It’s
public and it should all work, but I haven’t made any announcements
about it.

It’s not a secret, but [keep it under your hat](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/keep+%28something%29+under+one's+hat), ok?

P.S. The home page for the project is published at [https://xsltng.docbook.org/](https://xsltng.docbook.org/).
