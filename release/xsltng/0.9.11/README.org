Build status: [[https://circleci.com/gh/docbook/xsltNG.svg?style=shield]]

Hello. You’ve found this repository during it’s “soft opening.” It’s
public and it should all work, but I haven’t made any announcements
about it.

It’s not a secret, but [[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/keep+(something)+under+one's+hat][keep it under your hat]], ok?

P.S. The home page for the project is published at [[https://xsltng.docbook.org/]].
