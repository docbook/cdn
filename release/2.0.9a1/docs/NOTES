Named templates have '-'s not '.'s

Use tools/doccheck.xsl to check for documentation problems

Use tools/writetests to run the unit tests:

  1. Process html/docbook.xsl with tools/writetests.xsl using Saxon 8b
     (you need 8.4 patched). This will produce a stylesheet, tests.xsl

  2. Process tests.xsl with any input you want. This will produce an HTML
     summary of the unit tests.

Norm's notes to himself:

- Consider making <index/> contextual, so an index in a part, for example,
  can index just that part.
