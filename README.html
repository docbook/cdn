<h1>Welcome to docbook.github.com</h1>
<p>Last update: <?pubdate?></p>

<p>This site hosts the numbered releases of the DocBook XSLT 2.0
stylesheets as well as the JavaScript, CSS, and other ancillary files
referenced by those stylesheets.</p>

<p>You're welcome to leave the references in place (treating this site as a sort
of DocBook <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Content_delivery_network">CDN</a>),
or copy these
assets to your local server. You can download them by cloning
<a href="https://github.com/docbook/docbook.github.com">the
repository</a>.</p>

<p>These URIs may not be completely stable yet. I'm still trying to work out
the best way to deal with versioning the ancillary files. I'm also trying to work
out just how much disk space I can use at <a href="http://www.github.com/">github</a>
for this purpose before they start to get cranky.</p>

<p>Starting with the 2.0.2 release, this site hosts versioned copies of the stylesheets and
ancillary files.</p>
