<h1>Welcome to docbook.github.com</h1>
<p>Last update: <?pubdate?></p>

<p>This site hosts the “official” releases of the DocBook XSLT 2.0
stylesheets as well as the JavaScript, CSS, and other ancillary files
referenced by the DocBook stylesheets.</p>

<p>You're welcome to leave the references in place, or copy these
assets to your local server. You can download them by cloning
<a href="https://github.com/docbook/docbook.github.com">the
repository</a>.</p>

<p>I haven't worked out a policy for dealing with versioning the
ancillary files, so all that's available right now is “latest”. YMMV.</p>
